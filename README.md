# EOF
Simulation of electro-osmotic flow by Lattice Boltzmann method (Fortran)

The program is to simulate EOF based on N-S equation and PNP system.
The numerical method is Lattice Boltzmann method, which is suitable to simulate multiphysics system.
Here, D2Q9 Lattice is adopted. 
One can check the paper for other details.
